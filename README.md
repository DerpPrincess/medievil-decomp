To begin helping, you'll need to first understand the basics of Git version control system. This project uses a "Fork and Rebase" workflow, which means you'll need to click the fork button in the top right of the main repository page on GitHub to have the project in your own GitHub account. You'll need to keep your version of the project up to date with this main project tree by  having two remotes, yours and this one, hint: fetching all everytime you begin working and before making Pull Requests and make changes on your fork instead of through a branch on the main repository like you may be used to. Additionally, since we're using a rebase workflow, you'll need to rebase your branch against a target branch (typically main tree's main or dev branch). More information concerning this will be provided at a later time. Finally, when making changes the changes will be squashed and merged into one commit with all your changes. Ideally, you'll make as little changes as needed for your function.

So, this is a decomp project which means you'll be converting assembly code to C code. Information on how to do that will be added here soon.

Note, for legal reasons, please do NOT commit copyrighted content (source code, game disks, rom/iso files, etc.) to this repository. This project works by decompiling retail disks through legal means, you MUST provide the real game to do this but said real game should not be committed to this repository!
