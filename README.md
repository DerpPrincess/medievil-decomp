## Become a Contributor
This is a Work in Progress decompilation of the US [PSX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_(console)) version of MediEvil 1. There will be a sister link for MediEvil 2 here later but currently our priorities are focused on MediEvil 1. 

To get started, it is highly recommended that you both join the Discord server and also read our nicely written wiki page here: https://github.com/MediEvilDecompilation/medievil-decomp/wiki/Getting-Started

This project uses a Git Rebase Workflow, so you will need to fork a copy of this project onto your personal GitHub account. A guide on here to use this workflow can be found here: https://github.com/MediEvilDecompilation/medievil-decomp/wiki/Git-Rebase-Workflow 

It is highly recommended that you use Visual Studio Code as we have some nice features which will make the process smoother for you. You can find that information about that here: https://github.com/MediEvilDecompilation/medievil-decomp/wiki/Recommended-.vscode-settings
